This project is based on iris dataset which is a very famous dataset which the beginner uses to learn machine learning. Here in this dataset, different features like petal and sepal length and width in cm. Here I have used the Decision Tree Classifier as it is one which is used classify on the basis on entropy and information gain.

I have also provided the graphs seperately so it will provide the proper insights of the model and have also plotted the whole decision tree so that you can look forward how this algorithm has splitted the node, branches and child.
